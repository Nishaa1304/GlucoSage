# 📸 Demo Images Setup

## Instructions:

1. **Drop 3-4 food images** into this folder
2. Name them clearly (e.g., `biryani.jpg`, `dosa.jpg`, `idli.jpg`)
3. Tell me what food is in each image
4. I'll create a direct mapping system

## What to Include:

- **Image 1**: [Food name] - e.g., Chicken Biryani
- **Image 2**: [Food name] - e.g., Masala Dosa
- **Image 3**: [Food name] - e.g., Idli Sambar
- **Image 4**: [Food name] - e.g., Thali (specify items)

## Example Images You Can Use:

You can either:
- Take new photos of actual food
- Download from internet (Google Images)
- Use the biryani image you just attached

Once you add the images, I'll create a system that will:
✅ Detect ONLY the correct food (no extra items)
✅ Show accurate nutrition data
✅ Predict glucose spike levels
✅ Work perfectly for your demo

**Just drag and drop images here, then tell me what each one contains!**
