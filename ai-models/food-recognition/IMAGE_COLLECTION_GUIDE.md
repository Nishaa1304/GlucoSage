## 📸 Photography Best Practices

### **Lighting:**
✅ **Good:**
- Natural daylight (near window)
- Well-lit restaurant
- Even lighting (no harsh shadows)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Direct flash (washes out colors)
- Too dark (can't see food)
- Backlit (food in shadow)

### **Angles:**
1. **Top-down (90°):** Best for flat foods (roti, dosa, thali)
2. **45° angle:** Best for 3D foods (bowls, curries, biryani)
3. **Side view (30°):** For layered foods (stacked rotis, cake)

### **Composition:**
- Food should occupy 60-80% of frame
- Include some context (plate, table)
- Avoid extreme close-ups
- Keep background simple

### **Focus:**
- Ensure food is in sharp focus
- No blurry images
- Hold camera steady (or use tripod)
