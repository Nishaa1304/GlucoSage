# GlucoSage Logo Setup

## ✅ What's Been Done:

1. **Logo Integration**: Added logo to both Splash page and Dashboard
2. **Creative Animations**: 
   - Scale-in animation with rotation on splash page
   - Floating animation that loops continuously
   - Glow ring effect around the logo
   - Smooth slide-up animations for text
3. **Dashboard**: Mini logo in header with floating animation

## 📝 Action Required:

**Save your GlucoSage logo image:**

1. Save the logo image (from the attachment) as: `glucosage-logo.png`
2. Place it in: `frontend/public/glucosage-logo.png`

## 🎨 Animation Effects Applied:

### Splash Page (Get Started):
- **Logo entrance**: Scale from 0.3x to 1.1x with rotation, then settles at 1x
- **Floating effect**: Continuous up-down motion (3s cycle)
- **Glow ring**: Pulsing gradient glow behind logo
- **Background**: Animated blur circles for depth
- **Text animations**: Staggered slide-up with delays

### Dashboard:
- **Mini logo**: 48x48px (mobile) / 56x56px (desktop)
- **Floating animation**: Gentle up-down motion
- **Placement**: Next to greeting in header

## 🎬 Animation Timing:
- Logo: 0s (immediate)
- Title: 0.3s delay
- Tagline: 0.5s delay  
- Buttons: 0.7s delay

All animations use smooth easing curves for professional feel!
